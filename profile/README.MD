#Decentralized Crypto Exchange

A Decentralized Crypto Exchange is a place where people can go to trade cryptocurrencies without an intermediary. A DEX, lets people trade directly from their crypto wallets. The exchange doesn’t take control of their private keys or act as an intermediary. Instead, it uses smart contracts(self-executing programs) to facilitate peer-to-peer exchanges. A decentralized exchange (DEX) lets crypto holders remain pseudonymous and keep control of their crypto wallet’s private key.
The idea behind a DEX is "disintermediation," which means removing middlemen to
allow regular people to do business directly with each other. A DEX doesn't offer
custody of users’ crypto assets. Instead, users directly hold all their assets in their own
wallets at all times.
The exchange is implemented with smart contracts on an Ethereum blockchain and deployed on an Ethereum test network. In addition to implementing transactions between individual users, it also allows transactions among multiple users.
